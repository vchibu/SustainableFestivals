# Sustainable Festivals â€“ Transport Simulation Framework

This project models and analyzes the transportation impact of festival attendees, with the goal of improving the environmental sustainability of large-scale events. Developed as part of the ISBEP graduation project at Eindhoven University of Technology, the simulation framework evaluates how different transportation strategiesâ€”based on cost, time, emissions, complexity, or realistic behaviorâ€”affect mobility outcomes for a 20,000-person crowd traveling to and from the Lakedance Festival. The simulation integrates real-world OpenStreetMap and GTFS data through a self-hosted OpenTripPlanner (OTP) server and includes modules for carbon footprint estimation, behavioral logic, and multimodal transport routing.

The framework is divided into two main components. The **First Order Simulation** models individual attendee trips using five different decision strategies, allowing for detailed comparisons across emissions, time, cost, and convenience. The **Second Order Simulation** builds on these results by requerying the realistic scenario and analyzing road congestion, infrastructure usage, and potential externalities for non-attendees. The system is designed with modular Python classes, enabling extensibility to other festivals, cities, or transport interventions.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Simulation

1. **Clone the repository.**

2. **Install dependencies using:**
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Start the OTP server:**
    cd SustainableFestivals/OTP-Server
    java -Xmx4G -jar otp-shaded-2.7.0.jar --load ./Graph --serve
(You can increase the -Xmx4G flag depending on available RAM.)


4. **Run the First Order Simulation:**
    Open FirstOrderSimulation/Code/CallingCode/main.py and configure:
        - Which scenarios to run (carbon, cost, time, leg, realistic)
        - Whether to use precomputed data or rerun different parts of the simulation
    Then execute FirstOrderSimulation/main.py

5. **Run the Second Order Simulation:**
    Make sure that results from the realistic scenario already exist.
    Then execute: SecondOrderSimulation/main.py
